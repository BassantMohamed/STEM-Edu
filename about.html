STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, and encompasses a vast array of subjects that fall into each of those terms. While it is almost impossible to list every discipline, some common STEM areas include: aerospace engineering, astrophysics, astronomy, biochemistry, biomechanics, chemical engineering, chemistry, civil engineering, computer science, mathematical biology, nanotechnology, neurobiology, nuclear physics, physics, and robotics, among many, many others. As evidenced by the multitude of disciplines, it’s clear that STEM fields affect virtually every component of our everyday lives.

In the United States, STEM is of the utmost importance because of the role these subjects play at multiple levels of society, and the tremendous impact they have. Our country’s entire economy revolves around mathematics: accounting, economics, functions and logarithms, and calculus. The architecture industry is centered on math, as is urban development and city planning. Medical research is fueled by the study of chemistry and biology, and environmental efforts like sustainable energy and nuclear power are also steeped in the sciences. It’s impossible to find a part of society that does not, in some way, interact with these subjects, and since so many of these industries are coordinated by or connected to our government at some level, it’s safe to say that the very governing of our country depends on them. STEM is essential to our education system, as school districts across the country strive to build a stronger curriculum around these subjects.

	STEM Initiatives

<body>
	Despite America’s competitive edge in STEM industries, our nation has been experiencing a decline in the output of STEM talent that is not conducive to high demands. School curricula have been lacking in their math and science components, and in response to this decrease in STEM education, several initiatives have been started to reclaim the lead and produce literate, savvy, and driven young talent that will leave their indelible marks on STEM industries.

The STEM Education Coalition External link  supports STEM programs for teachers and students at agencies that offer STEM related programs, such as the US Department of Education and the National Science Foundation. The STEM Education Coalition defines itself External link  as “an alliance of more than 500 business, professional, and education organizations, works aggressively to raise awareness in Congress, the Administration, and other organizations about the critical role that STEM education plays in enabling the U.S. to remain the economic and technological leader of the global marketplace of the 21st century.
